# Artificial-NN

Here, I have implemented an Artificial Neural Network which is built from scratch and used MNIST database to classify digits
### Architecture :
      Input Layer : Shape (784,)
      Dense Layer 1 -> Neurons : 22, activation : tanh()
      Dense Layer 2 -> Neurons : 15, activation : tanh()
      Output Layer -> Neurons : 10, activation : softmax

### Dependencies :
      1.NumPy
      2.Matplotlib
      3.Pandas
      4.Keras
      5.SKLearn
      
      
### Regarding Accuracy :

The Accuracy obtained is 62%, which is expected as ANN doest specialize in Image classification. However, the tuning of Hyperparameters
and architecture can lead to better results.
